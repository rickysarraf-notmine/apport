Provides: core-dump-handler
Description: automatically generate crash reports for debugging
 apport automatically collects data from crashed processes and
 compiles a problem report in /var/crash/. This utilizes the crashdump
 helper hook provided by the kernel.
 .
 This package also provides a command line frontend for browsing and
 handling the crash reports. For desktops, you should consider
 installing the GTK+ or Qt user interface (apport-gtk or apport-kde).

Package: python-problem-report
Section: python
Architecture: all
Depends: ${python:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends}
Description: Python library to handle problem reports
 This Python library provides an interface for creating, modifying,
 and accessing standardized problem reports for program and kernel
 crashes and packaging bugs.
 .
 These problem reports use standard Debian control format syntax
 (RFC822).

Package: python3-problem-report

Description: Python library for Apport crash report handling
 This Python package provides high-level functions for creating and
 handling apport crash reports:
 .
  * Query available and new reports.
  * Add OS, packaging, and process runtime information to a report.
  * Various frontend utility functions.
  * Python hook to generate crash reports when Python scripts fail.

 ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: gdb-multiarch
Description: tools for reprocessing Apport crash reports
 apport-retrace recombines an Apport crash report (either a file or a
 Launchpad bug) and debug symbol packages (.ddebs) into fully symbolic
 stack traces. This can optionally use a sandbox for installing debug symbol
 packages and doing the processing, so that entire process of retracing crashes
 can happen with normal user privileges without changing the system.
 .
 You need to install gdb-multiarch if you want to be able to retrace crash
 reports which happened on a different architecture than the one you run
 apport-retrace on.

Description: valgrind wrapper that first downloads debug symbols
 apport-valgrind is a valgrind wrapper that automatically downloads related
 available debug symbols and provides them to valgrind's memcheck tool, which
 is executed. The output is a valgrind log file ("valgrind.log") that contains
 stack traces (with as many symbols resolved as available) and that shows
 memory leaks.
